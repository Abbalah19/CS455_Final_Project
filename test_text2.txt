Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; 
but what I have ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of La Mancha, is that he was on the 
road all day, and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all around to see if 
he could discover any castle or shepherd’s shanty where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not 
far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; 
and quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two young women, girls of the 
district as they call them, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn; and as, 
happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what 
he read of, the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining 
silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this inn, 
which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would 
show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing 
that they were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived 
the two gay damsels who were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease 
at the castle gate.

At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any 
apology, that is what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote 
to be what he was expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he rode up to 
the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning 
in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry 
dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, “Your ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, 
for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your 
appearance proclaims you to be.” The girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the 
clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so much out of their line, they could not 
restrain their laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, “Modesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter that 
has little cause is great silliness; this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serve 
you.”

The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased the ladies’ laughter, and that increased 
his irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had not come out, who, being a very fat man, 
was a very peaceful one. He, seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his saddle, bridle, 
lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth, 
standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, “Señor Caballero, if your 
worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is plenty of everything else here.” Don Quixote, 
observing the respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, 
“Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for

‘My armour is my only wear,
My only rest the fray.’”

The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a “worthy of Castile,” though he was in fact an Andalusian, 
and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a page. “In that case,” 
said he,

“‘Your bed is on the flinty rock,
Your sleep to watch alway;’

and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say 
for a single night.” So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got down with great difficulty and 
exertion (for he had not broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse, as he was the 
best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote 
said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the 
damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate 
and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it 
with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means 
consent to, so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while 
they were removing his armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said 
to them with great sprightliness:

“Oh, never, surely, was there knight
So served by hand of dame,
As served was he, Don Quixote hight,
When from his town he came;
With maidens waiting on himself,
Princesses on his hack—

—or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse’s name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention 
of declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the necessity of adapting that old 
ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. A time, however, will 
come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.”

The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted 
anything to eat. “I would gladly eat a bit of something,” said Don Quixote, “for I feel it would come very seasonably.” The day 
happened to be a Friday, and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in Castile “abadejo,” in 
Andalusia “bacallao,” and in some places “curadillo,” and in others “troutlet;” so they asked him if he thought he could eat 
troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. “If there be troutlets enough,” said Don Quixote, “they will be the same 
thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may 
be that these troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat. But whatever it be let it 
come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the inside.” They laid a table for him at 
the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a 
piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on 
and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and this 
service one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would have been so had not the 
landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore with 
patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.

While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, 
and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and that they were regaling him with music, and 
that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan of the castle; and 
consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not 
been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of 
knighthood.
